# Hello, I'm Marcel Berger

üíª Senior Software Architect, Cloud Engineer & Digitalization Expert ‚Äì with 20 years of deeply rooted IT expertise
*Java Mastermind ‚Ä¢ Quarkus Pioneer ‚Ä¢ Flutter Expert ‚Ä¢ DevOps Guru ‚Ä¢ IT Strategist with Hands-on Mentality*

I'm not a showman. I'm straightforward in the Hanseatic way ‚Äì born and raised in Osnabr√ºck, with a clear edge, technical depth, and a solution-oriented mindset. If you're looking for someone who talks instead of delivers, you're in the wrong place. But if you need someone who pragmatically implements digital projects, takes responsibility, and isn't afraid of complexity ‚Äì then welcome.

My story begins sometime in 1989 or 1990 ‚Äì nobody knows exactly anymore. Facebook hadn't been invented yet, film for cameras was expensive, and if you wanted to capture memories, you needed either a good camera or a damn good memory. But the ENERGY STAR logo already existed ‚Äì and I had my first computer: a Weico Computer running Weico DOS. BASIC was my first language ‚Äì long before I mastered German grammar. Pascal, C, Java, Python followed ‚Äì and a career that took me through many worlds: from the shell to the cloud, from startups to corporations, from the terminal to the boardroom. I grew up in a world where you still configured the BIOS manually, Stack Overflows couldn't be googled, and you learned to manage memory efficiently ‚Äì experiences that shape me to this day.

I develop scalable enterprise backends with Java, automate workflows with Camunda BPMN, bring complex systems to the cloud (Azure, Kubernetes, Civo), and develop native mobile apps with Flutter. I think long-term, with Nordic pragmatism, and develop with a clear goal: software that works. Today, tomorrow, the day after.

Besides my passion for software, I worked for many years in the hospitality industry on cruise ships and in upscale hotels. I've opened bars, led teams, planned events, and delighted international guests. This time taught me: leadership is more than project planning, communication more than emails, resilience more than a buzzword. I combine the charm of a host with the analytical depth of an IT architect.

I studied Business Information Systems, trained as a restaurant specialist and bar master (IHK). Not just hard on the keyboard, but also hard at work. I'm a fan of electronic music and long nights ‚Äì sometimes for programming, sometimes for partying. I find my balance between lines of code and beats. Structure, pragmatism, and solution-oriented action are always at the forefront for me.

I'm like North German weather: clear, straightforward, with depth. I analyze like a CTO, act like a captain in a storm ‚Äì and always stay on course.

Anyone who googles me finds not just code, but concepts. Not just skills, but solutions. Not just projects, but results. Welcome to Marcel Berger ‚Äì the architect behind performant, secure, and economically sensible IT. Real. Honest. Efficient.

## Professional Background

I've been developing enterprise software long before "digitalization" became a buzzword in boardrooms. Whether regulatory financial systems with the highest security requirements, process platforms in the energy sector, complex identity management solutions, or AI-powered document analysis ‚Äì I deliver IT solutions that work. Robust, scalable, understandable.

For me, IT is not an end in itself, but a strategic tool. I don't think in features, but in **real business value**. My systems are designed to be **productive tomorrow**, **extensible the day after**, and still **maintainable and cost-effective** in five years. I make architecture decisions based on facts ‚Äì focusing on **clean code**, **maintainability**, **scalability**, **security**, and **operating costs** throughout the entire lifecycle.

Currently, I lead **digitalization and project coordination** in a company of **critical infrastructure (KRITIS)**. There I am responsible for the **digital strategy**, develop process digitalization, automation solutions, and secure cloud architectures, lead my team professionally and organizationally, and manage complex projects with high visibility up to the executive level.

Before that, I was an entrepreneur and managing director of my own software company for over ten years. During this time, I:

- **Managed several million-euro projects** ‚Äì from acquisition through architecture and implementation to operations
- **Built and led cross-functional teams** consisting of developers, architects, DevOps engineers, and UI/UX designers
- **Developed APIs and microservices architectures** that are now productively used in financial institutions, industry, and the energy sector
- **Established governance, security, and compliance structures** to meet regulatory requirements securely and verifiably
- **Built CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and automated deployments** to significantly reduce time-to-market and operating costs
- **Created technical documentation, architectural decisions, and operational concepts** that were as understandable for stakeholders as they were precise for developers

I can **plan**, **architect**, **develop**, **operate** ‚Äì and **explain** software. Understandably. Responsibly. Reliably. I combine **technical depth** with **strategic thinking**, speak the language of developers and decision-makers, and always keep the big picture in mind: **business value, quality, security, and sustainable IT architectures**.
